Significant updates in 2025 for Indian citizens applying for U.S. visas include a new Visa Integrity Fee, stricter rules for interview waivers, and centralization of certain visa processing in India. 
Fees and visa integrity surcharge
New Visa Integrity Fee: A new non-refundable $250 "Visa Integrity Fee" is required for most nonimmigrant visa applicants from countries not in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, including India. This became effective on October 1, 2025, and is in addition to the regular visa application fee.
H-1B Fee Increase: As of September 21, 2025, employers filing for new H-1B visas are subject to a one-time fee of $100,000 per petition.
Visa Rescheduling Fee: Beginning January 1, 2025, applicants in India can only reschedule their appointment once without repaying the visa fee. A second or subsequent reschedule requires paying the fee again. 
Interview waivers (dropbox)
Reduced Eligibility: Effective September 2, 2025, the U.S. Department of State significantly reduced the categories of applicants eligible for an interview waiver, or "dropbox" appointment.
Nearly all applicants must be interviewed: Most applicants, including children under 14 and adults over 79, are now required to appear for an in-person interview. Exceptions are limited.
Limited interview waivers: Some renewals for B-1/B-2 visitor visas and certain other categories may still be eligible, but only if applied for within 12 months of the prior visa's expiration and other conditions are met. Consular officers still have the discretion to require an interview.
Centralized Dropbox Processing: In India, the processing for certain interview waiver cases has been centralized:
B-1/B-2 visitor visa interview waivers are processed exclusively in New Delhi.
H and L interview waivers are processed in Chennai. 
Appointment procedures
Centralized Interviews for H&L Visas: First-time H and L visa interviews in India are now centralized in Hyderabad.
Appointment Location Policy: Effective November 1, 2025, immigrant visa interviews will be scheduled in the applicant's country of residence or nationality. Nonimmigrant interviews are generally scheduled in the country of residence or nationality.
Passport Collection: As of August 1, 2025, third-party collection of passports is banned. Applicants must either collect their passport in person or pay for courier delivery. 
Processing times
Visa Bulletin for October 2025: For employment-based categories, Indian nationals in EB-2, EB-3, and EB-5 saw forward movement in the October 2025 visa bulletin. Many applicants can use the Dates for Filing chart to apply for adjustment of status sooner.

For employment-based petitions like I-140 and family-based petitions like I-130, processing times vary based on the specific category and USCIS workload. 
Additional update for students
